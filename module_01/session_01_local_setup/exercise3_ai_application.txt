Topic: AI Handwriting Recognition with IDA (PLANET AI)

One of the most fascinating AI applications I recently discovered is 
PLANET AIâ€™s IDA Handwriting Recognition system. Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) 
is one of the most complex tasks in AI because everyone writes differently, 
documents vary in quality, and historical scripts introduce unique challenges. 
IDA uses over 30 years of AI expertise to accurately recognize modern and historical 
handwriting, even in poor-quality documents. It supports multiple languages, optimizes 
images automatically, and scales to process hundreds of thousands of pages per day. 
This technology creates real value in government agencies, archives, cultural institutions, 
and scanning services by transforming handwritten information into structured, searchable 
data within hours instead of weeks.
