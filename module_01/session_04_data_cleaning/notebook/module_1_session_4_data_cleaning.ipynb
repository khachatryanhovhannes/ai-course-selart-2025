    "\n",
    "After performing the initial data diagnosis using `df.info()`, `df.isnull().sum()`, and `df.describe()`, several critical data quality issues were identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Completely Empty Columns**  \n",
    "   - The `Ticker` column was entirely empty (100% missing). This makes it unusable for any type of analysis, so it must be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Columns with Extremely High Missing Rates**  \n",
    "   - The `Salary` column contained over 94% missing values, combined with inconsistent formats (different currencies, hourly/monthly/yearly time bases). This made the column unreliable and not worth cleaning for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Categorical Columns with Missing Values**  \n",
    "   - Several categorical columns — including `Category`, `Keywords`, `Contract Types`, and `Job Status` — had a significant number of missing values. These needed to be filled with a consistent placeholder to avoid data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Date Columns Stored as Strings**  \n",
    "   - Date fields such as `First Seen At`, `Last Seen At`, and `Job Last Processed At` were stored as object (string) types. This prevented time-based analysis and required conversion to proper datetime format.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Minor Missing Values in Key Columns**  \n",
    "   - Columns like `O*NET Code`, `O*NET Family`, `O*NET Occupation Name`, and `Job Language` had only a handful of missing rows compared to the dataset size (~9,900 rows). These could be safely dropped to maintain column integrity.\n",
